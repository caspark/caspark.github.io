title: Hey there!

You're probably reading this because you're trying to find out more about me, so let's deal with that.

I'm from Perth, Australia originally, moved to Sydney in 2013, and since 2017 I live & work in San Francisco.

I've been coding since I was 11 (though back then I wasn't so good at putting semicolons in the right places), starting with making 2D games and eventually some basic 3D games.

Since then I've built networked desktop apps, built Eclipse IDE plugins, interfaced with old-school mainframes, made various websites and web apps, maintained old enterprise web apps, extracted microservices from existing monoliths, spun up and matured greenfield microservices, and learnt enough functional programming that I can delude myself into thinking I can explain what a monad is.

Eventually I realised I get a lot of satisfaction out of unblocking and mentoring other people, so I became a team lead, which is still a blast: building high performing teams is like optimizing and debugging software, only harder.

But I try to keep in touch with tech; I'm excited about

* Rust - which I used to run the Sydney Rust meetup for - is opening up systems programming to a whole bunch of people for whom it was too inaccessible before, and that's a great thing.
* Unity/Unreal - these AAA engines have been available for years, but VR/AR hype has driven a significant increase in graphical computing power.

Yet if you ask me to build something from scratch, I'd pick Python or Java.

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing video games (Overwatch and any indie or couch multiplayer games), snowboarding, strength training and modern ballroom dancing. I also read a hell of a lot.
